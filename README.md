All the code featured in my Respond 2014 presentation.

This code is written to be quite minimalist, and I'd recommend structuring things a little differently in real life.

1. I've used a shared.css file - this is designed to show much overlap there is between the patterns shown
2. The JavaScript was written to show how you can do away with jQuery, and whilst it will work on a wide range of devices you may need to use a fallback for some of the functions used.

Examples
--------

* [Do Nothing](http://www.david-lewis.com/respond/do-nothing.html)
* [Toggle](http://www.david-lewis.com/respond/toggle.html)
* [Fly Out](http://www.david-lewis.com/respond/toggle.html)

Enjoy!
